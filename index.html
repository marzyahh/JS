I don't know too,\f let see\n and what about Vertical Tabulator?\v sorry:( the last one is backspace by \b and don't work for me cause I think I didn't set lan for html tag:|\n and we know that for show single and double quote use \' or \" and for show backslash use \\ "

    /*
    some important Notes:
    1) we defined variables in JS by three ways: a) the first one is the use "var", b) second is use "let" and c) third one is "const".
    2) when u used const one its means fix for ever, u can't change it in another place of ur code
    3) I changed all of them from var to let, I got this massage error: "*Uncaught SyntaxError: redeclaration of let a, note: Previously declared at line 11, column 8*" 
    so what means that??? means we can't use let for defined one variable and change it in somewhere??
    4) u can't use "var" in some where and in another where use "let" for same variable
    5)fifth point is about structure of variables, this variables(also function and class) are case sensitive means that Capitalization is matter,  there is a  difference between variable
    that called "number" and another one that called "Number", if u have a two variable that called by one name, the second one will be overwrite and this one
    accept but if u just change the first letter by capital this problem is solved, so I watch this part again and I think means of Case sensitive is some thing else:
    u can have a two variables with same name but  different value just by use capital or small latter(u can making difference by this in their name)
    but I think this isn't a good description for case sensitive, oh I'm wronnngggg, this point is about camelCase structure not that I explain,
    so camelCase is like which one that I write "camelCase" meaning that when u wanna to called a variable with two or more part, u should written it like this: first letter is saml, first letter of each other words should be Capital.
    6) I think I read in somewhere that variable can't be start with numbers, YEs, I tried and it's true
    also can be start with an other mark??? expect "$" and emmmm I can't remember:/
    7)do u defined a string variables with "double qout"? yes, I do... how a bout a string variable with double quote within(right inside the string)??
    it's simple question, we have three ways: a) use backslash/ before a double quote in within string, b) set all string in back ticks(`this mark`) even string with single quote or double
    ans 3) is set string in single quote.

    8)we can do 4 original operation on numbers plus reminder(add+, sub-, multiplying*, dividing/, remainder%) and also we can incrementing(add one) and decrementing(sub one) a variable, show in example...
    and we can try any one of this operation on decimal numbers, just see them in examples

    9) for study about Escape Sequence in JS read the related examples
