// it's a little difference about other topics, so i create new file 
// JS Callbacks:::::
// sometimes we want call a function in an an other function, just like an argument(run first fun throw second ones )
// and even we can run the second fun after running first fun has done(finished)
// so I think I don't learn very well, I think I need to learn them  in project more
// I study about callback, asynchronous , Promise and wait but I don't understood very well
